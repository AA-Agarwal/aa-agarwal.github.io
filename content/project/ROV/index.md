title: Underwater Rov 
summary: Engineered an advanced underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) system capable of performing complex tasks at depths exceeding 1000 meters below sea level. The core innovation involved implementing a sophisticated Fuzzy PID control algorithm for precise kinematic motion control of dual hydraulic robotic manipulators - a 4-DOF and a 6-DOF arm. The integrated control system successfully compensated for extreme underwater conditions while maintaining operational stability. The combination of fuzzy logic with traditional PID control enabled adaptive responses to varying underwater conditions and payload requirements, ensuring precise manipulation capabilities in deep-sea operations.

## Summary
Engineered and implemented sophisticated PID control systems for dual robotic manipulators (4-DOF and 6-DOF) on an underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), achieving precise manipulation capabilities at depths up to 100 meters. This project was funded by Aker Solution Pvt Ltd and was completed and approved as a capstone project requirements for MIT World peace university. The system successfully demonstrated stability in various underwater conditions while maintaining positioning accuracy within Â±2mm.

## Technical Implementation:
- Developed a comprehensive mathematical model using MATLAB/Simulink to simulate arm dynamics and optimize control parameters
- Designed adaptive PID controllers with anti-windup mechanisms to compensate for underwater disturbances and varying payloads
- Integrated custom-designed digital filters (Butterworth low-pass and high-pass) to process sensor data, reducing noise by 85% and improving motion stability
