An experimental investigation into the effects of contact damping and surface roughness on rotor dynamics, focusing on interference fits between components. The research involved designing and testing a custom Internal Friction Instability Test Rig (IFITR) to validate theoretical models and improve understanding of rotordynamic stability.

## Objectives
- Verify the relationship between contact pressure and interface damping using beam-block experiments
- Design and fabricate a test rig to study internal friction instability
- Validate theoretical models for predicting Instability Onset Speed (IOS)
- Investigate the effects of surface roughness on system stability
