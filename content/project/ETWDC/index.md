With a team of 10 students, they designed, manufactured and tested road legal and safe electric two-wheeler. Although designed for SAEâ€™s ETWDC 2019, this prototype had larger implications. Powered by a 2 HP BLDC motor, 1.7KWh custom battery pack and smart driving features this prototype secured the 2nd overall place amongst 75+ teams in India. Later we extended our vision to making one service 4-wheeler.
